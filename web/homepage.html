    <p class="mainPara">Welcome to my homepage! My name is Suzanne Brenchley. I would love to show
      you some pictures and help you see a little bit into my life and what I do
      everday.</p>

    <p id="weddingPara">My husband and I met in May of 2016. We went on one
      date the day we met, and then Preston had to leave back to his job in
      Mississippi because he was only in town for his sister's wedding. When he went
      back to work he talked to me on the phone everyday! After being gone just
      three days, he put in his two weeks and decided to take a risk and come
      back and date the girl he thought might be his wife. Well it worked out in
      our favor and we were married on October 22, 2016 in the LDS DC
      Temple. It was the most amazing experience and I feel blessed everyday to
      have married such a loving man.</p><br clear="left"/>

    <p id="nannyPara">I spend Monday-Friday nannying children. It is my favorite
      thing to do and I have done it since I was in high school. I currently nanny
      for two different famlies, each with three children. I get to spend my days
      playing with sidewalk chalk, playing in the pool, hanging at the zoo, and am
      always up-to-date on the latest animated movies. It's the best job in the world
      and I will definitely miss it once I graduate and have to get a "real" job.</p>

    <p class="mainPara">Besides nannying and school there really isn't much to know about me! I love
      swimming and just spending time with my big family of eleven. I live in VA and
      don't think I will ever leave. I am an east-coast girl for life!
